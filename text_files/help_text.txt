**NOVA-AI Discord Bot Help**
**Ways to interact with me:**
1. Mention me (@NOVA-AI) followed by your question
2. Use the `!ask` command followed by your question
**How NOVA mentions people in replies:**
- Include the token `@user` in your question and NOVA will replace
    it with the person who asked the question.
- If NOVA outputs something like `@Alice`, she will try to resolve
    `Alice` to a server member and convert it to a proper mention
    (e.g. `<@1234567890>`). Use full usernames or display names when
    possible to improve matching.
3. Use `/help`
**Examples:**
- @NOVA-AI @user tell me a joke
- !ask @Bob what's your favorite color
- /help


**Note:** You can DM NOVA directly or mention her in server channels.
She will look up server members when resolving names for mentions.
